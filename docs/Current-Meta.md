This is a list of meta that are currently in use on SecretHitler.io.

[[Click here|Notes for Newcomers]] to return to my notes on basic strategies.

## November 2018

Opening meta is most developed for 7p, 5p (and to a smaller extent 10p) games.

* In 5 player games, the order is either:
  * 14 41 etc. until a red is played, at which point the govt. becomes 25, 42, 53 or 13, or
  * 14 41 etc. until the 1st deck finishes (either 5 govts. of 14/41 have passed)
* In 6 player games, the order is 14 25 36 4-BP.
* In 7 player games, the order is either:
  * 15 26 37 45 or 46 if 15 was red, or
  * 15 26 37 51 etc. (the "skip 4" meta), or
  * 15 26 51 62 etc.
* In 8 player games, the order is 15 26 37 48.
* In 9 player games, the order is 16 27 38 49 5-anyone blue.
* In 10 player games, the order is 16 27 38 49 5-10.

Investigation meta on drawing RRR is most commonly:
* Investigating your chancellor;

Investigating another president who also claimed RRR is neither recommended nor widespread.
