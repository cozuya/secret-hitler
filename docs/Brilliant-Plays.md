### Scorcha creates a fas-fas conf in a 5p game

Scorcha (seat 1, Hitler) conflicts BoJo (seat 4, Fascist) in a 5p game, making the score 4-3. Scorcha peeks RRR, but claims RBR, and the table topdecks twice, outing Scorcha.  Fas win by a 3rd top-deck, although a more competent BoJo would have won quicker.
