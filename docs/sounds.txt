Sound for specific people/timing:
- Policy enaction sound effect does not play during veto stage, and is overtake by the veto sound effects
- Observers are unable to hear sound from in game
- Investigation sound effect is only heard by investigator and player investigated
- Policy peek sound effect is only heard by player peeking
- President drawing sound effect is only heard by current President
- Chancellor receiving sound effect is only heard by current chancellor
- Special Election sound effect is only heard by player who has been given the Special Election
- Every other sound effect runs normally throughout the game and is heard by every player
- In a players personal settings they can disable all sound effects, as I can see some may find it disturbing for gameplay
