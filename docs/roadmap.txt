(#306) fix to people being (again) able to make accounts with the same name but different capitalization - done
(various) overhaul/fixes to moderation problems (banning/timeouts not working) - in progress
(#251) URL routing for entire application (clickable links to games/replays/profiles) - mostly done, needs to run through all possible actions, updateUserStatus isn't working right (icons in Playerlist aren't correct after some routes), doesn't delete a game when you create it and then route away from it in the way it does now, most likely "DANGER" problems but I'm thinking it will just bounce them back which means they need to click leave and then click the DANGER model which is fine.


farther future:
(#275) Remake button when game is dead/completed/afked on
(#205) player notes
(#204) gamenotes enhancements
(#184) tournament mode - still need to decide on requirements for this
(#198) game creator should have extra powers - kick/pause timer/etc

version 1.0
convert to webpack/create-react-app for builds - will resolve safari problems
all desired features in all bugs fixed
