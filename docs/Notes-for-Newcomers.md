These notes are from are from my own experience playing on SecretHitler.io and watching high-ELO games there. I hope these notes give you some idea of what the more recent strategies for both teams are.

I assume some basic knowledge of the game already: there is a glossary [here]() for any terms I use that are unknown to the reader. As a result, these notes are not comprehensive, but instead focus on strategies and considerations that are less well known to newer players.

That being said, at the end of the day SH is just a game, and the goal remains to have fun.

# Why people insist on a Meta
On SecretHitler.io, people tend to insist on a "Meta" (_i.e._ a set of conventions as to who should you nominate as chancellor? who should you investigate as president?) Metas are considered by some to be controversial, but I think they help the game develop.

When liberals deviate from the meta, _it's a crapshoot_. Occasionally you get lucky, and you improve your winning chances. Yet other times, you probably made things worse. But when fascists deviate from the meta, they'll pretend they deviated randomly, but _they **always** deviate in a way that helps fascists._

So if you allow deviations, fascists can take advantage: liberals can't.

If you see someone deviating from the meta, they're either a lib, and the deviation could be good or bad, or they're a fascist, and the deviation is always bad. If you're more competitive, you assume that nothing is ever accidental, and they're hurting the liberal team, and they're not accidentally hurting the liberal team, etc., etc., and so they're probably a fascist.

# A word on the Hitler Zone, the Special Election, and Gunpoints.

## Hitler Zone
**Focus on the presidency, and get the _most liberal guy_ in the presidency.** The chancellery will take care of itself. _This is true regardless of which team you are on._

Liberals have two things to worry about in the Hitler Zone. One, that Hitler gets elected chancellor. Two, that a fascist president gets elected. One seems much scarier than Two, but Two is _much more important_ than One.

Firstly, unless you are _extremely_ good, you probably can't tell who Hitler is. Hitler can be quiet or loud, he can be more of a leader, and he can be more of a follower. **You just have to live with the risk of a Hitler election**. Unless you realise this, it is far too easy for a fascist to scare people off a liberal chancellor by insinuating that they might be Hitler.

What's the problem with having a fascist elected president? Well, recall that any president in a government that plays the 4th or 5th red gets to shoot somebody. And the chances of drawing RRR or RRB are good enough for fas that electing a fascist president in the Hitler Zone is usually game winning for the fascists. 

In a 5p, 7p, or 9p game, shooting a liberal means that the liberals no longer have a majority, and fascists now have a 2nd game-winning strategy if they cannot or don't want to pretend to be liberals anymore: _fascists can top-deck to the end._ 
  * _The odds of fascists winning via top-decking range from over two-thirds (when the score is 4-4) to 75% (4-5) to virtually 100% (there are less than 4 blues already enacted or other special circumstances)._

The fascist strategy is split between trying to install a Fascist or Hitler as president and trying to elect Hitler as chancellor. 

The liberal strategy is to stop Fascists from taking the Presidency.

## Special Election
As a liberal, **You should always Special-Elect the most liberal player to be president**. If you trust them enough to give them a potential bullet, then you should also trust that they won't deliberately nominate Hitler as chancellor. Trust their judgement here. 

If, however, the president whose govt. played the 3rd red Special-Elects a president who claimed RRR or somebody in conflict, and the table „nein“s the SE'ed president, the SE is said to have been _thrown_. In fact, anyone who chooses somebody dodgy to SE is probably a fascist.

With all due respect to tartanllama, who recommended making the most trusted player chancellor and giving the presidency to somebody else, it is usually far better to avoid a slow and certain death via top-decking than to be paranoid of accidentally dying by electing Hitler chancellor.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## Gunpoint

If everybody agrees that a certain person is the most likely to be liberal, the table might let that person _gunpoint_ someone else. 

That is, the president and chancellor both get elected, and if the president draws RRB and gives his or her chancellor RB, either the chancellor plays the blue, or the chancellor plays the red, at which point the president can execute him. Obviously, if the president draws RBB he simply forces BB, and if the president draws RRR then well, it didn't matter who the president nominated.

**As long as you trust the president, you can „ja“ even if you are certain that his or her chancellor is fascist.**

# Card Counting
In an ordinary game, there are **6 blues** and **11 reds** in the deck. After five govts. pass, the deck is reshuffled. (If you like, you can take 11 hearts and 6 spades, shuffle them, and see how many spades you tend to get in the first 15 cards.) 

Roughly half the time, you will get **5 blues** in the first **15 cards** / **5 govts**; another half, you will get **6 blues**. Very rarely, (about 11% of the time), you will get only **4 blues**. This is the natural deck, and this is what fascists work with.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## As a liberal
**Pay attention to the deck.**

Always force (pass "BB") to your chancellor if you draw "RBB". If you give your chancellor "RB", you should be and will be under continued suspicion that you made a blue up, and makes it that much harder for liberals to verify what you really drew. If you force, two people (you and your chancellor) can confirm that two blues have been seen. 

If you give your chancellor a choice and they play the red instead, this is terrible, and any loss will be blamed on you.
_The normal price for a conflict is the loss of one blue. The price of gaining information through a conflict **through the loss of two blues is way too high.**_

A common and generally accepted behaviour is to claim "RBB" when you drew "BBB" even as a liberal. There is no consensus as to the extent to which this lie helps or hurts liberals.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## As a fascist
**Pay attention to the deck.**

Work out when to gain trust, possibly at the cost of playing a blue, and when to play a red, which is actually your formal job. 

Claiming RRB when you drew RBB increases trust on you and your chancellor while making any presidents who claimed RRR a bit more suspicious.

If you're Hitler and you receive RBB, you can discard a blue. If your chancellor plays the red, you cover your fascist by claiming RRR. If your chancellor plays the blue, however, you can claim to have drawn RRB.

If your government is fas-fas and the president draws RRB, it is possible for both players in the govt. to lie and claim RBB and BB respectively.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## Claimed decks
These are how many blues the first five governments claim to have seen.

### 7 blue deck
This is a deck that cannot occur naturally. Somebody has overclaimed (claimed to have drawn more blues than they really have), probably to provide some cover to a fascist teammate who can then claim "RRR". Those presidents whose chancellors are unable to provide verification are most likely to be under suspicion, like presidents who claim BBB, presidents who claim to have given a choice to their chancellors, or presidents who claim RRB and have conflicted with their chancellors.

### 6 blue deck
This is a very good deck for liberals. There will be little to no blame placed on any RRR presidents: they still won't look liberal, but they won't look fas either.

### 5 blue deck
This is a fair deck for liberals. You probably half-suspect that somebody _underclaimed_ (drew "RBB" but only claimed "RBB"), but things are still looking fine. You probably play people who played blues quite preferentially over anybody who's claimed RRR though.

### 4 blue deck
This is where things get serious. Since naturally occurring **4 blue** decks are so rare, you assume that any RRR president could have dropped a blue, or that a fascist has underclaimed. You do not nominate or play any president who claimed RRR.

### 3 blue deck
This is a deck that cannot occur naturally. The game is almost certainly in the Hitler Zone after five governments. Scream at every RRR president, interrogate every RRB president, and intimidate every RBB president. I assume that you, the reader, are yourself beyond reproach at this point. There is no way on earth you even remotely trust any president or chancellor who was part of a RRR government.

# Conflicts
If two people accuse each other of being fascist, do not take sides. Liberals shouldn't know who to trust, and therefore fascists should pretend they don't know who to trust either. 

That said, as the game continues, based on voting and behaviour, you should probably have some inclination _but very rarely_ complete certainty.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

### Delayed Conflicts
Delayed Conflicts work for both teams. Honestly, they usually help fascists more than they do libs, so _delayed conflicts_ and _fake conflicts_ are never held for very long at higher ELO level games.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

### Counting the Number of Conflicts
Be aware of how many conflicts there are at any point. For example, in a 7p or 8p game, there are only three fascists, so if there are three conflicts, then you should have one or two confirmed/guaranteed liberals.

Bearing in mind the number of conflicts also helps you when you are mentally weighing up possible fascist teams.

# Misc Tips
## Peeking at the Deck [5/6p]

If the peek is claimed to be Blue-something-something, you should Top-deck. Either you get a free blue or the president who peeked is outed as fascist. _Having a confirmed outed fascist is a significant disadvantage in a 5 or 6 player game._

If the peek is claimed to be Red-Blue-something, you can still consider Top-decking.

If the peek is claimed to be Red-Red-Blue, _be aware that liberals can lose if the peek is actually RRR._

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## Veto Zone

In the veto zone, unless a president draws RBB, **liberals need a govt. of a liberal president and a liberal chancellor** in order to not lose immediately. In particular, the orientation of the govt. does not matter, _i.e._ XY = YX. 

As a result, Confirmed Not-Hitlers become less important, because the risk of a fascist victory through passing 6 fascist policies outweighs the risk of electing Hitler chancellor.

[[ [back to top]|Notes for Newcomers]]

## Irrational voting

One of the most common ways for liberals to figure out what the fascist team is when an inexperienced fascist team votes as a bloc. The further along the game is, the more likely it is that the voting blocs reflect the teams.
