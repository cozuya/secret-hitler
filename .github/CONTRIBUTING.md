Hello and thanks for considering contributing to this project. Any accepted PR will be rewarded with a special contributor status on the site and color!
If you're new to programming in general and want to get started, I would recommend the visual studio code editor (not visual studio) and I like my setup which
you can find here: https://github.com/cozuya/visual-studio-code-settings-and-snippets

I only have the following guidelines:

1. Before working on a feature, a) make sure its an open, not "suggested" issue on the github issue page and b) it is unassigned. If you start working on
	something non-trivial, ask in discord dev channel to have it assigned to you.

2. Your code should pass lint.

3. Your editor should use prettierjs.

4. Functions that either a) return a value or b) have arguments (non-anonymous/lambda) that aren't obvious i.e. not i/index/event should use JSDoc comments to explain the types and return types of that function.

5. If you make a feature, please commit to supporting it. If there's problems on an issue you've completed, please make sure you can take care of it.
