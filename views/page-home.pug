					p Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late. Read #[a(href="/rules") the rules] to learn more, #[a(href="/how-to-play") how to play] to learn about the UI, or hop into the #[a(href="/observe") the game lobby] itself right now.

					p Version 0.3.2 "avocado" released 5-27-2017
					h3 New feature: player status icons in the lobby.  Players in game will have a "SH" icon.  Players observing will have a magnifying glass icon.  Click either (while not in a game) to be routed to the game that player is in.  Feature courtesy of jbasrai @github.  Contribute to this open source project to get a cool orange name!
					ul
						li Irritating private games that never get started now get deleted after 10 minutes.
						li Fix to a front-end issue with observer chat.
						li Another attempt to fix gamelist sort.
						li A small global black list of "bad words" and word fragments for user names and game names has been implemented.  While this is a (very mildly) adult-themed game, some stuff is not cool.  Tongue-in-cheek Nazi references and swear words?  Probably fine.  Racism/sexism/homophobia/antisemitism?  No thanks.
						li Something special now happens when you win a game..
					p Version 0.3.1 "mint" released 5-25-2017
					h3 New feature (sorta): player colors in both game and general chat.  This can be disabled with a new player setting in the settings menu (click "gear" icon while not in a game).
					ul
						li A new info component is in the lobby/playerlist.  Click it to understand the player name color schemes.
						li Fix to "chancellor in veto zone can't click a card, hanging the entire game" bug that to be honest I have no idea where it came from, but it should be working now.  Sorry about that.
						li Looks like there was one crash bug left and only happened a couple times per day, this patch will attempt to fix that. Without further breaking stuff.
						li Fix to gamelist sort bouncing around like crazy (I hope, this is like the 3rd time I've tried to fix it).
						li Enhanced the player colors a bit, and took out bolded player names as it was a bit much.
						li Increased threshold for being in the "top tier" on the playerlist from 30 to 50.  This will put only colored (bad choice of words..) players on the top.  I think this incentivizes people a bit.
						li Stats page only refreshes once per day now.
					p Version 0.3.0 "teal" released 5-23-2017
					h3 New feature #[a(href="/stats") game stats].  Pretty basic to start, but interesting.  Will expand more on that later.
					p Other changes:
					ul
						li Fixed the last crash bug for real this time.  I mean it.
						li More fun name color stuff:
						ul
							li >55% win rate < 60% win rate: light purple
							li >300 games played: very dark green
							li The (immediate) above and the dark purple players are bolded.  Beware.
						li also moved the 2nd tier of win rate from 10 minimum games to 30 minimum games if that makes sense.  Custom player name colors also appear in both general and game chat!  Wow your friends!
						li Bug fix to (#34) when the status bar wrapped the styling was off slightly.
						li Bug fix to (#2) left sidebar gamelist sorting.. I hope.  It SHOULD be: unstarted games on top, in progress games in the middle, completed games on the bottom.
						li New component: "footer" on the bottom of the default/lizard screen that has a new "changelog" component and links to the github issues page.	
					p Version 0.2.3 "plum" released 5-20-2017
					p Several small changes and fixes:
					ul
						li Fixed the last (??) crash bug.  Stability should be achieved!  Until someone finds more.
						li Added a 150 millisecond #[a(href="https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function" rel="nofollow") debounce] to both general and game chat.  Effectively users can not spam uncontrollably.  Should help with troll problems.  If this is too much/little please give feedback.
						li Players names in the userlist in upper right corner now have some special colors:
							ul
								li >50 games played: light green
								li >100 games played: darker green
								li >200 games played: even darker green
								li >60% win rate: purple
								li contributer (code): orange.  If you know even a bit of javascript and want to make some changes to this game, please feel free to contact me/submit a pull request.
								li admin: red
						li Games that have not started yet are sorted to the top of the game list on left sidebar.  It should have always been this way but was broken in a dumb way..
						li Fix to garbage collected games bugging out the UI before they are updated?  I think.
					p Version 0.2.0 "violet" released 5-16-2017
					h3 New feature: automated claim system
					p After the following actions:
					ul
						li President receives 3 policies and chancellor completes his or her discard
						li Chancellor receives 2 policies and completes his or her discard
						li President peeks at the top 3 policies
						li President examines party loyalty
					p A glowing "C" will show up in the lower right corner of chat for those players.
					div(style="text-align: center")
						img(src="images/claim-button.png", style="margin-top: 0")
					p Click that, and the chat window will be overlaid with a new modal.
					img(src="images/claim-modal.png", style="margin-top: 0; text-align: center")
					P Click your action (or click the C again to dismiss) and a new type of chat will appear, informing players about what you say happened.  You have until the next election to do this action.
					img(src="images/claim-text.png", style="margin-top: 0; text-align: center")
					p Let me know if you like/hate this, and any issues or requests about it.
					p Next up: stats page.
