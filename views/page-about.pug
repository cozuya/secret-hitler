			h1.ui.centered.header About Secret Hitler IO
			p You can contact the team at secrethitlerio at gmail dot com.
			p Application designed and developed from the original board game by #[a(href="http://www.TwoLongOs.com") Chris Ozols].  Due to a fairly complicated UI and text-driven gameplay this application is not mobile-optimized, but should work OK on mobile devices in theory.  Source code available at #[a(href="//github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler") github].  Bugs/issues?  Contact us via email, discord channel, or #[a(href="https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/issues") open a github issue].
