			h3.ui.header Alterations to the original game
			ul
				li Minor image alterations and editing.
				li Veto power is slightly adjusted so that chancellors need to select a policy prior to saying yes or no to vetoing that policy.
				li Adapted the rules webpage slightly to account for online vs physical play.
				li There is an option when players make a game to "rebalance" the 6, 7 and 9 player games - 6p starts with a fascist policy already enacted, 7p starts with one less fascist policy in the deck, 9p starts with 2 less fascist policies. Players (and results from analyzing statistics) have noted that these game modes are the worst balanced and not fun to play with the original ruleset.
