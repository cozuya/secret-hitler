			h3.ui.header What are player profiles?
			p Player profiles help you measure a player's performance across games. A profile includes various stats and a list of recent games played. You can access a player's profile by clicking their username in the Lobby.


			h3.ui.header Why do the stats in player profiles not match up with the stats in the Lobby?
			p Due to technical limitations, stats reflected in player profiles will only track matches starting this release version #[em 0.5.0] onward.


			h3.ui.header What does &nbsp; __________ &nbsp; stat mean? What is a "standard match"?
			p Look below for more detailed documentation on how games are counted and stats are calculated.


			h3.ui.header Why are you calculating &nbsp; __________ &nbsp; stat this way?
			p Choosing how to calculate a stat is tricky. My philosophy is that a stat should measure either an objectively good action or a playstyle trait but not both.
			p For example, "Vote Accuracy" is an example of an objective stat. The rationale is that if a Fascist becomes president in hitler zone, it is an objectively worse position for the Liberal side - voting "nein" is always better. However, voting for a Liberal president is less clear-cut. A conservative player might opt to vote "nein" to gauge the votes and gain information, while an aggressive player might vote "ja" to take a gamble or gain trust. Therefore, votes on Liberal presidents are based on playstyle and shouldn't be conflated with an objective measure.


			h3.ui.header You should add a stat to track &nbsp; __________ &nbsp.
