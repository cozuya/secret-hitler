			li Attempting to show private information (i.e. screenshot of cards or role)
			li Stating which role card you have (i.e. “old lady”)
			li Using key phrases to share information (i.e.  saying “im hit” only as lib)
			li Using key phrases to influence specific people (i.e. pinky promises)
			li Threatening to blacklist a player if they don’t do what you want
			li Lying with relevant claims as a liberal, unless covered below
			li Talking in a language that not everyone knows (english is always acceptable)
			li Voice-Chat only games, unless explicitly put in the game room name
			br
			p The following is allowed:
			li Ignoring “meta” or “correct order” of play
			li Using a personal meta that does not break the above rules (i.e. never lying on claims)
			li Having a discussion on what to do, even if it takes a long time, unless all other players are asking for play to continue
			li Having a play-style that can reveal information (i.e. never conflicting as chancellor), provided it is not claim-based (i.e. only claiming BBB as lib)
			li Lying about what cards you had or what role you saw as a liberal, and then revealing what you actually had/saw later on (no later than when the deck ends)
