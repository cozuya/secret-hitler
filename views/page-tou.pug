			h3.ui.header General
			p The site is provided free of charge to everyone, and is subject to the occasional failure that is out of our control. We are not responsible for you losing out on a sure win, it happens.
			p Breaking any of the rules listed below is subject to warnings and moderative action against your account, and in extreme cases we may revoke your access to this site.
			p Additionally, any malicious activity (i.e. trying to crash the site) or attempts to intentionally subvert rules using gaps in rulings or loopholes will be considered breaking the rules.

			h3.ui.header Acceptable Language
			p In general, most language is acceptable.
			p Forbidden language:

			li "Retard" and similar
			li "Cunt" and similar
			li Words that are equivalent to those listed above (i.e. "libtard" for "retard")
			p Using these words (and those like them) is subject to moderative action regardless of if it was reported, unless it is in a private game.
			br
			p Other forbidden behaviour:
			li Following a player and commenting on their games after they've asked you to stop
			li Talking about a game (i.e. possible fas lines) after a player asks you to stop
			li Talking about an ongoing no-chat game via general chat

			p This does not apply to private game chat.
			
			h3.ui.header Accounts
			p Accounts generally follow Acceptable Language for what is allowed on them. Private accounts are not subject to moderation, but can only play in private games.
			p Account names strictly follow Acceptable Language rules. Any account found breaking this rule will be toggled private, or banned if severe enough.
			p Card-backs follow Acceptable Language, and additionally must not contain images from the site that can appear over the card-back, anything that would be unsafe for work, or nazi imagery. Card-backs breaking this rule will be removed. Animated card-backs will be converted to a static image.
			
			h3.ui.header Gameplay
			p All players are expected to play fairly and reasonably in non-casual, non-private games. Casual games are more loosely moderated, and private games are mostly moderation-free.
			p The following is not allowed:
			li Colluding or multi-accounting to gain an advantage
			li Leaving mid-game or refusing to play
			li Intentionally playing to lose
			li Intentionally playing sub-optimally (i.e. playing poorly to spite another player), unless it is a casual game
			li Using tactics not possible in person to gain an advantage (i.e. claiming misclick when conflicting)
			li Attempting to show private information (i.e. screenshot of cards or role)
			li Stating which role card you have (i.e. “old lady”)
			li Using key phrases to share information (i.e.  saying “im hit” only as lib)
			li Using key phrases to influence specific people (i.e. pinky promises)
			li Threatening to blacklist or report a player if they don’t do what you want
			li Lying as liberal, unless it benefits your team (examples below)
			li Talking in a language that not everyone knows (english is always acceptable)
			li Voice-Chat only games, unless explicitly put in the game room name
			br
			p Examples of when to lie as liberal (not a complete list):
			li Claiming BBR when receiving BBB - Discourages fascists from discarding blues
			li Claiming BR when receiving BB - Testing to see if hitler is president
			li Claiming a liberal is fascist on investigate - Fake conflicting to get reactions
			p Any conflicts (i.e. BRR vs RR) started by a liberal must be resolved before the next government, unless you can prove it is beneficial to maintain it. Additionally, lies in general should be resolved by the time the deck ends, or when hitler zone starts.
			br
			p The following is allowed:
			li Ignoring “meta” or “correct order” of play
			li Using a personal meta that does not break the above rules (i.e. never lying on claims)
			li Having a discussion on what to do, even if it takes a long time, unless all other players are asking for play to continue
			li Having a play-style that can reveal information (i.e. never conflicting as chancellor), provided it is not claim-based (i.e. only claiming BBB as lib)
			li Maintaining a severe lie as liberal (i.e. conflicts), provided you can prove it benefits your team when questioned
