				strong General
			p The site is provided free of charge to everyone, and is subject to the occasional failure that is out of our control. Sometimes you may lose on a sure win due to technical issues. In these situations, just like in general, elo refund is sadly not possible.
			p Breaking any of the rules listed below is subject to warnings and moderative action against your account (regardless of if you were reported), and in extreme cases we may revoke your access to this site.
			p Most violations will be addressed with a Warning &gt; Timeout &gt; Ban protocol, unless otherwise stated. Multiple warnings and timeouts can be issued to one player based on their offense and their history.
			p Additionally, any malicious activity (e.g. trying to crash the site) or attempts to intentionally subvert rules using gaps in rulings or loopholes will be considered breaking the rules.
			p To request mod assistance during a game, ping @mod followed by a space and the message (e.g. @mod 6 is afk). You can only do it while sitting in the game, and once every 3 minutes per lobby. You may also ping @Moderator on our Discord server, or simply report a player by double clicking on their username in case of a rule violation.
			h2
				strong Language and Behavior
			p In general, most language is acceptable.
			p
				strong Forbidden language:
			li Anything racist (including calling others &quot;ape&quot; or similar)
			li Anything sexist or homophobic
			li Anything anti-specific-religion or anti-atheism
			li Hate speech
			li Directed abuse (personal insults, attacks, harassment,&nbsp;doxxing&nbsp;etc.)
			li Excessive sexual content
			li Discussions in non-english, except for brief instances and as long as there is no conflict with any other rule
			p
				br
				strong Explicitly forbidden words:
			li Highly racist slurs (e.g. n-word) - Likely ban on sight
			li Homophobic slurs (e.g. fag), or other highly offensive slurs
			li &quot;Retard&quot;
			li &quot;Cunt&quot;&nbsp;
			li Words that are equivalent to those listed above (e.g. &quot;libtard&quot; for &quot;retard&quot;)
			p
			br
			strong Other forbidden behaviour:
			li Following a player and commenting on their games after they&apos;ve asked you to stop.
			li Talking about a game as an observer (e.g. possible fas lines) after a seated player asks you to stop.
			li Talking about an ongoing no-chat game via general chat.
			li Spoiling films, TV shows, or similar without waiting until its season/screening no longer airs.
			li Advertisement, engaging in excessive and unnecessary drama or unwarranted attention seeking/self pity posts.
			li Any usage of bots.
			li Impersonation of any player; impersonating moderators will be treated more harshly. Additionally, account names must not be too similar to other unique usernames without that user's permission.
			p
			br
			p Anything not listed above is probably fine to use, provided there is no malicious intent or spam.
			p This also applies to game room names, even if the room is private, unless it is anonymous only. Forbidden room names will be reset unless the room is Unlisted.
			h2
			strong AFK Policy
			p AFK players are given 3 minutes to return and continue playing before they are in violation of our ToU. Any room waiting on an AFK player is asked to report the player to moderators and wait those 3 minutes before remaking/leaving. The AFK player is still encouraged to return if the lobby is still active, even if the 3 minutes passed, in which case the AFK will be excused.
			p AFK penalties increase based on the number of AFK's a player has within the 24 hour period following their last valid AFK; if more than 24 hours pass, the chain is reset. The penalties are listed below:
			p
			li 1st AFK - No punishment
			li 2nd AFK - 6 hour timeout
			li 3rd AFK - 18 hour timeout
			li 4th AFK - Ban
			br
			p Any player found to be AFK'ing too frequently, but not being banned by the procedure, may still end up banned.
			br
			p In some cases, a player is allowed to leave an active game without punishment. Aside from leaving due to IRL emergencies, a player may leave before the first election is voted on if...
			li they don't have time to play.
			li they don't want to play the selected mode (meta is not a game mode)
			li there is a seated player they have blacklisted. For any of these situations, a player's leave may be excused if they ping a mod before leaving.
			br
			p Please note - Ragequits will progress a player's AFK chain, in addition to receiving the RQ penalty.
			h2
				strong Accounts and Cardbacks
			p Account names strictly follow Language rules. Any account found breaking these rules will be toggled private permanently. Private accounts are not subject to moderation, but can only play in private games.
			p
				strong Card-backs follow Language rules, and additionally must not contain:
			li Images from the site that can appear over the card-back or similar enough to cause confusion.
			li Anything that the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at in a public or formal environment, anything that can be considered NSFW or potentially disturbing content.
			li Nazi imagery, including Swastikas, SS, salutes, Nazi portraits or anything alike.
			li Card-backs breaking this rule will be removed. Animated card-backs will be converted to a static image.
			h2
				strong Gameplay
			p All players are expected to play fairly and reasonably in ranked (non-casual, non-private, non-custom, non-unlisted) games. Casual games are more loosely moderated, and private games are mostly moderation-free. Unlisted games are not moderated unless the link is shared publicly.
			p
				strong The following is not allowed:
			li Colluding or multi-accounting to gain an advantage - Will be banned instantly if sufficient evidence is discovered
			li Ragequitting/loss dodging/refusing to play - 18 hour timeout in addition to be counted as an AFK
			li Fake ragequitting - 6 hour timeout and the game to be remade if players believe it to have unfairly influenced the game.
			li Ragequitting/loss dodging/refusing to play threats - 1 hour timeout and the game to be remade if players believe it to have unfairly influenced the game.
			li Stalling when all other players have asked you to move on
			li Intentionally playing to lose
			li Intentionally playing sub-optimally (e.g., playing poorly to spite another player), unless non-maliciously in a casual game
			li Using tactics not possible in person to gain an advantage (e.g., claiming you misclicked on card selection or on shot. This does not include correcting misclaims.)
			li Attempting to show private information (e.g., screenshot of cards or role)
			li Stating which role card you have (e.g., &ldquo;old lady&rdquo;)
			li Using key phrases to share information (e.g., saying &ldquo;im hit&rdquo; only as lib)
			li Using key phrases to influence specific people (e.g., saying you will delete your account if you&rsquo;re lying)
			li Attempts to unfairly influence games (e.g., blacklist mentions, report threats, calling for mods over gameplay style)
			li Lying as liberal, unless it benefits your team (examples below)
			li Use of a non-english language, unless explicitly stated in the game room name (this includes speaking in lobby chat while seated in a game)
			li Playing voice chat games, where not every player has access to the voice chat, unless explicitly put in the game room name
			li Communicating with another player while dead.
			p
				br
			p
				strong Examples of when to lie as liberal (not a complete list):
			li Claiming BBR when receiving BBB - Discourages fascists from discarding blues
			li Claiming BR when receiving BB - Testing to see if hitler is president
			li Claiming a liberal is fascist on investigation - Fake conflicting to get reactions
			li Any conflicts (e.g. BRR vs RR) started by a liberal must be resolved before the next government, unless you can prove it is beneficial to maintain it. However, lies in general should be resolved by the time the deck ends, or when hitler zone starts.
			p
				br
			p
				strong The following is allowed:
			li Ignoring &ldquo;meta&rdquo; or &ldquo;correct order&rdquo; of play
			li Using a personal meta that does not break the above rules (e.g., never lying on claims)
			li Having a discussion on what to do, even if it takes a long time, unless all other players are asking for play to continue
			li Having a play-style that can reveal information (e.g., never conflicting until the last blue), provided it is not claim-based (e.g., only claiming BBB as lib)
			li Maintaining a severe lie as liberal (e.g., conflicts), provided you can prove it benefits your team when questioned
			li Playing sub-optimally in casual games in order to test new ways to play
			h2
				strong Disclaimer
			p AEM reserves the right to determine what conduct is considered to be a violation of the rules established. Rules open to interpretation are to be decided by AEM on whether specific actions are violations. If a member of AEM requests you not do something, continuing such action will be punishable. All moderative actions are taken as a team. This means there is always a discussion involved, so as to prevent biased, rushed or inconsistent actions. If you believe you have been unfairly punished, please do not hesitate to contact moderators on mod-support in our Discord server.

					u Moderative Actions
			p The list below shows the number of times one may expect to be warned/timedout for a certain infraction.
			p Note that the following list is the general template of the expected actions.
				u
					strong Moderators can&nbsp;still skip some, or all actions&nbsp;based on the specific case, history of the player, and if there&rsquo;s malicious intent. Infractions, either listed or not listed below, are to be punished based on&nbsp;moderator discretion&nbsp;in accordance with the general ruling.
			p Punishments get progressively harsher as the offender repeats the infraction, ultimately resulting in a ban.
