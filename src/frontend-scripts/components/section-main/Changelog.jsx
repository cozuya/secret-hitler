					Creating a public elo game now defaults to only verified accounts being able to sit in the game (if the game creator is verified). Verified accounts
					are those who have successfully confirmed their non disposable email address, or are using sign in with Github or Discord. This will solve various
					moderation problems. If everyone hates this, I will consider reverting this change. Please read our email terms of use (cliffs: will never email you
					other than initial verification and password resets, your email will never leave the site). -coz

				<h3>Badges this season are thanks to player liberalist!</h3>
				<p>
					It took a while, but we're here - all major features I could think of and some I couldn't are in and mostly working. A long, long way from the first
					stable(ish) release back in May 2017.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to thank our moderation team first and foremost. The site would not be in the same shape without them. There was a time that feature wasn't
					even in and it was just a nightmare. Obviously its a combination of both the theme and the nature of a mostly anonymous internet, but they've done an
					amazing job keeping this place playable in public games and fun for everyone!
				</p>
				<p>
					I also want to call out contributor/mod Hexicube for spending so much working on various parts of the app over the last ~year. Many moderation tools
					and features like custom games would not exist without him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note that 1.0 does not mean I am no longer supporting the application and site. Work will continue to make the site even better, but not
					personally at the pace I have been. My next game is in progress and I expect to get to a playable pre-alpha state some time in the next few months. It
					will be a (fresh IP) hidden role game with some similarities to the fascist hunting/electing game we all know and love but with some fun features and
					mechanics that can only exist online. Stay tuned! -Chris
				</p>
				<p>This update also includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed player claims showing under player chat instead of game chat.</li>
					<li>Broadcasts will now always show regardless of filters.</li>
					<li>Fixed cardbacks sometimes failing to upload.</li>
					<li>Game remaking no longer shows "1/NaN" before the game starts on non-custom games.</li>
					<li>Fixed alts/trials showing as grey in user list.</li>
					<li>Elo slider minimum is now 1600.</li>
					<li>Cardbacks now support all image types, and all sizes.</li>
					<li>Game remaking now updates the blacklist if the creator changed theirs.</li>
				</ul>
