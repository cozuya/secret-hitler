				<h3>New feature: Player moderation</h3>
				<p>Some players have volunteered to be moderators.  They are empowered to have the ability to ban non-rainbow players for griefing and trolling, and to check for cheating. Hopefully this (and some more advanced powers from admins) will be a permanent solution to problems that may come up.  Moderators will have a red (M) next to their names.</p>
				<h4>Other updates</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>A fix to the rainbow game icon on the gamelist only being there for games that haven't started yet.</li>
					<li>A fix (finally) to dead players being able to chat by leaving the game and coming back.</li>
					<li>A 3 second delay has been implemented between the inactment of a policy by the chancellor, and the ability for the government to make a claim (for non-experienced games only).  This should change game play a lot I think..</li>
					<li>Various tooltips have been added to some items and will continue to be addded in the future.</li>
					<li>A fix to rainbow losses also adding to normal losses, but not the other way around.  I'll see if there's a way to credit those.</li>
					<li>Contribution by player sethe: a fix to the (relatively rare) problem of the election tracker not working right with vetos and neins.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Up next: player profiles.  This is just about ready to go and will be released within the next 2 days.</p>
				<div className="ui header">
					<p>Version 0.4.0 "chestnut" released 6-5-2017</p>
				</div>
				<h3>New feature: Rainbow games.</h3>
				<p>While creating a game, players with more than 50 completed games ("rainbow players") will now be able to create games that only other rainbow players can be seated in. These games have a special symbol in the sidebar.</p>
				<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
					<img src="images/gamelist-rainbow.png" />
				</div>
				<p>In the lobby, a new icon appears showing what game style you are filter and sorting the userlist by.  Click it to switch between "regular" and "rainbow". Effectively, rainbow players get to "start over" in an optional hard mode with a 0-0 score.</p>
				<p><b>For rainbow games, your wins and losses are in a different tier, that does not affect your regular game winrate or player color.</b>  "Rainbow rewards" may come in at some point.</p>
				<p>Also in this release, the karma system has been temporarily disabled due to griefers exploiting it.  The next major feature is <b>player moderation</b>, where I will be enlisting some of our regular players to help out in getting rid of griefers and trolls.  This isn't all that hard and will be coming soon, and hopefully guarantee a better playing experience for everyone.  Please check the github issue if you are interested in helping out.</p>
