				<h3>Badges this season are thanks to player liberalist!</h3>
				<p>
					It took a while, but we're here - all major features I could think of and some I couldn't are in and mostly working. A long, long way from the first
					stable(ish) release back in May 2017.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to thank our moderation team first and foremost. The site would not be in the same shape without them. There was a time that feature wasn't
					even in and it was just a nightmare. Obviously its a combination of both the theme and the nature of a mostly anonymous internet, but they've done an
					amazing job keeping this place playable in public games and fun for everyone!
				</p>
				<p>
					I also want to call out contributor/mod Hexicube for spending so much working on various parts of the app over the last ~year. Many moderation tools
					and features like custom games would not exist without him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note that 1.0 does not mean I am no longer supporting the application and site. Work will continue to make the site even better, but not
					personally at the pace I have been. My next game is in progress and I expect to get to a playable pre-alpha state some time in the next few months. It
					will be a (fresh IP) hidden role game with some similarities to the fascist hunting/electing game we all know and love but with some fun features and
					mechanics that can only exist online. Stay tuned! -Chris
				</p>
				<p>This update also includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed player claims showing under player chat instead of game chat.</li>
					<li>Broadcasts will now always show regardless of filters.</li>
					<li>Fixed cardbacks sometimes failing to upload.</li>
					<li>Game remaking no longer shows "1/NaN" before the game starts on non-custom games.</li>
					<li>Fixed alts/trials showing as grey in user list.</li>
					<li>Elo slider minimum is now 1600.</li>
					<li>Cardbacks now support all image types, and all sizes.</li>
					<li>Game remaking now updates the blacklist if the creator changed theirs.</li>
				</ul>
