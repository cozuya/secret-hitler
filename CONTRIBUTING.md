Hello and thanks for considering contributing to this project. Any accepted PR will be rewarded with a special contributor status on the site and orange color!
I only have the following guidelines:

1. Before working on a feature, a) make sure its an open, not "suggested" issue on the github issue page and b) it is unassigned. If you start working on	something non-trivial, ask in discord dev channel to have it assigned to you.

2. Your code should pass lint.

3. Your code should use prettier with the following options: use-tabs: true, single-quote: true, print-width: 160.

4. Functions that either a) return a value or b) have arguments (non-anonymous/lambda) that aren't obvious i.e. not i/index/event should use JSDoc comments to explain the types and return types of that function.

5. If you make a feature, please commit to supporting it. If there's problems on an issue you've completed, please make sure you can take care of it.
