# 💛Contribution Guidelines:

***Want to [contribute](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this open source product?  Check out the github page and issues - any accepted [pull request](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/pulls) will get you a cool orange name!***

### **Contributing Guidelines:**

Hello and thanks for considering contributing to this project. Any accepted PR will be rewarded with a special contributor status on the site and orange color!
If you're new to programming in general and want to get started, I would recommend the visual studio code editor (not visual studio) and I like my setup which
you can find here: https://github.com/cozuya/visual-studio-code-settings-and-snippets

I only have the following guidelines:

1. Before working on a feature, a) make sure its an open, not "suggested" issue on the github issue page and b) it is unassigned. If you start working on
	something non-trivial, ask in discord dev channel to have it assigned to you.

2. Your code should pass lint.

3. Your editor should use prettierjs.

4. Functions that either a) return a value or b) have arguments (non-anonymous/lambda) that aren't obvious i.e. not i/index/event should use JSDoc comments to explain the types and return types of that function.

5. If you make a feature, please commit to supporting it. If there's problems on an issue you've completed, please make sure you can take care of it.

### **Contributing to the Site:**

#### **Initial Code Installation Steps:**

- Follow the step-by-step instructions more specifically detailed in the [Read Me](https://github.com/cozuya/wiki/Read-Me).

#### **Local Host Testing in Development Mode:**

- From the instructions you follow in the Read Me of the wiki/site, you will also have clarity on how to locally host your fork of the master branch in order to better dev test any potential fixes you might submit via PR to double check that your ideas will work without a hitch.

- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) when you are actively hosting your code to see the changes you make and test them.

- To test AEM functions just make sure you either assign yourself one of these roles in your forked copy of constants.js or just login to your localhost:8080 as someone who already is coded as such.

- Your locally hosted site is not reliant on the server nor will it mess up anything on the main branches of the real active code. Specific Passwords are not needed to create your own account of an AEM member. Just remember you need to initially sign up for any new account as your code/site default starts with no accounts in its database memory. 

#### **Dev Helper Accounts:**

- In order to make games and test new features faster in them, we provide default Dev Helper accounts across the top of the /game page easily ready for use.

- On your first run through of accessing your local code via the link above, you will need to make all of the "quickdefault" accounts with the default password, **snipsnap**, so that you can log in to an account in one click.

- Uther, Jaina, Rexxar, Malfurian, Thrall, Valeera, Anduin, aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd, eee, fff, ggg, hhh

- To better use the Dev Helpers, you'll most likely need a browser extension such as Chrome's [openMultiLogin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openmultilogin/lbofelamdnfmipbbgkebcpkapahbmcgm?hl=en) to have multiple sessions on the same browser.

- Once a successful pull request is merged into this open source code project, as thanks for contributing, the Admin provides special award role status on the Game Site, Discord, and here on GitHub.

#### [Secret Hitler.io](https://secrethitler.io)

- On the game website when someone has contributed code to the open source project on GitHub, they get a special **orange** color as well as be endlessly pestered about why they are orange.

#### [Discord](https://discord.gg/secrethitlerio)

- In Discord, Contributors are provided 6 different color roles in addition to the default **orange** color role already given after a successful contribution to the project on GitHub. Just ping an @🔰Editor when you decide which color is right for you.

   - @❤Contributor (orange default role/color)

   - @💗Contributor - Pink 
   - @💙Contributor - Blue

- This will help be evident of your prior experience in coding for the site.
