# Terms and Guidelines

_Note: All rights regarding play on the services of secrethitler.io are reserved. No rights can be claimed from these terms and guidelines, they only serve as a line for the team to moderate and manage the game._

1. Constitution of Policies (approved 5/2/2018 in issue #652)

  -  An issue is made on the GitHub explaining in clear detail what the policy means and if it is a change to an existing policy. Any player is allowed to suggest changes this way.
  -  An @ðŸ”°Editor or above approves the central idea as being possible (and not being a repeat of a previously denied idea).
  -  A majority vote is run through the AEM team, of which all members are asked to participate, to vote for or against the suggested policy change.
  -  On a majority vote of which more than 75% of the AEM team has voted, and more than half of the votes were yes, the policy is essentially enacted.
  -  The policy is run by the @ðŸ”°Editor team once more, but thoroughly, to make sure it does not conflict with any existing rules.
  -  The policy is enacted and publically announced to the player base.
