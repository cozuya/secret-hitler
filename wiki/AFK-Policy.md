# AFK Policy for Secret Hitler

*People who go AFK (away from keyboard) for too long ruin games and are no fun to deal with! This is the plan to combat the issue and nuisance of AFK'ers* 

## General Rule

If Administrators, Editors, and/or Moderators (here on out referred to as 'we' or 'AEM' [pronounced aim]) see you (the player) are afk in a game we will begin compounding losses **on a daily basis** to your score in the following manner:

- First time: ignore
- Second time: +1 loss
- Third time: +4 losses and an 18 hour timeout
- Fourth time: immediate ban
  -  **Serial akf'ers  (more than 3 instances in a short span of time ~ 1 day) will be banned!**

> ***Note:*** *your case will be inspected and we will determine if you are actually "afk" (up to AEM's discretion)*

> ***Note:*** *If you going afk becomes a habit over a few days (even if just once a day), you will also be subject to a ban*
## FAQs

- "What if I am only afk for a bit?"
  -  If you are afk for longer than 3 minutes, it is considered an offense

- "What if I am longer than 3 minutes but don't want to receive punishments?"
  -  Then inform those you are playing with that you will be afk for a while and receive their consent

- "I was afk and believe I received punishment unfairly! Who do I talk to?"
  -  Please, contact an AEM right away, we are on your side but still have to deal out punishment fairly to all players.  Be respectful and understanding to the AEM member you are dealing with (all final cases can be appealed to an Editor, but after that, no more arguing your point)

## AEM Notes

- Check the #player-reports channel in the [discord](discord.gg/secrethitlerio) for instances of afk
- Copy user's ign (in game name) and head over to the Moderation Log
- Hit 'F3' key and paste
- Look for the latest instance of "AFK - ___ " from that day (EST)
- Add the next number to their losses and make separate comment saying " AFK - 'xth' "
###
     Ex:
         |  Mod  |      Date      | Action      |    User     |      IP       |    Comment   |
         |  coz  |  x/x/x  xx:xx  |             |    DFinn    | xx.xxx.xxx.xx |  AFK - 'xth' |
         |  coz  |  x/x/x  xx:xx  | setLosses-x |    DFinn    | xx.xxx.xxx.xx |     -'x'     |


*Please take advantage of the ability to add specific losses instead of having to recalculate the value itself.*
- Be sure to use the correct emojis to "fill out" the player report of the afk
  -  add the ✅ when completed along with the corresponding number of times afk in the particular day using: :one: ; :two: ; etc... *remember to use* 🔁 *for repeats of previous reports*

> **TL;DR: Don't go AFK...**
