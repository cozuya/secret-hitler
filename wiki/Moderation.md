# 🌀Moderation Guidelines (living document) v15 12/10/2017:

***We are NOT currently seeking applicants at this time. When we do seek applicants, a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/issues) will be opened and the direct link for that specific issue will be added to this page.***


> - [List of current Moderators](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/wiki/Moderation#list-of-current-moderators)

 
### **Absolutely no tolerance for:**

* Racism/sexism/homophobia/spamming/harassment/hate speech/antisemitism (or other religions but calling that one out for obvious reasons)/cheating/multi-accounting aka multi-windowing.  We want these people banned right away - if someone who needs to be banned is playing in a game, please be nice and wait until that game is done.  If you do not have time for that, please *at least* inform the game through observer chat.

* Player uploaded cardbacks should be safe for work, contain no nazi imagery whatsoever, and not look like part of the game to fool people.

### **Moderator discretion:**

* Bad manners: afking, throwing games, tilt, chat abuse, etc. Case by case basis here especially if they are a rainbow player (which they *hopefully* will not be).
* Tongue in cheek WWII references in user names and game names.  Lets face it its a game about (lizard) nazis, a memey user name like "HutlerDidNothingWrong" is probably OK if they do not push it.  4chan will be here regardless.

[Blacklisted word fragments list](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/blob/master/iso/blacklistwords.js) - let me know if you can think of obvious ones that need to be added here.  Patterns that match any of these cannot be used for usernames or game names.

### **Moderator guidelines:**

We would prefer moderators play with the "Show Right Sidebar in Game" setting on so they can keep an eye on general chat but not a huge deal since you will see it after games are done.

We want Moderators to be subscribed to the bug/feedback report (We will need your email address for this) and get emails when we get them and try and deal with it if you are available.  We would also like mods to have a GitHub account and subscribe to the entire repository for updates.

We would like all Moderators to be ambassadors for the game and to behave respectfully at all times towards players new and old, other moderators, and even people who need to be banned.

Basically, just enforce the terms of use found on [The About page.](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/wiki/About-Secret-Hitler)

> ### Terms of Use *(general)*
> 
>Don't cheat. Don't be a jerk/excessive abusive chat. Don't collude. Don't try to turn away newbies from your games. Don't attempt to circumvent things like not being able to select text from the game chat or screenshotting/uploading your role. No TOR users - if you have a legitimate issue where you need to use TOR, contact the Moderators. No homophobic/racist/sexist/Nazi/hate speech/anti-Semitic stuff. Play to win for the team you're dealt. Be a good loser and a gracious winner. Have fun!
> 
> ### Terms of Use *(player uploaded cardbacks)*
> 
>Everything in the general terms of use, plus: no pornography or anything nsfw, no Nazi imagery whatsoever including images of historical figures (very slight exemptions for parody may be OK on a case-by-case basis - no swastikas), no images/screenshots of the game itself to attempt to trick people (no matter how amusing it is...)
>
> ### Terms of Use *(IP addresses)*
>
>Moderators have access to see your IP address on a private moderation panel. This is used solely to guard against cheating and is never publicly available.
>
> ### Terms of Use *(private games)*
>
>While some leeway may be given at moderator discretion, private games are still subject to the above site rules. Private games are not really private in that anyone can observe them, but only seated players and moderators can see chat.

## Being an Active Moderator

In order to keep the role of Moderator, one must be active on the site.  This involves playing the occasional game with new and old players, investigating player reports, and using the Moderation log and powers.  It also helps tremendously if you are also active on the discord as well (preference on being a level "Bad Fascist" or higher).  If you appear to be inactive you are subject to having your role revoked.

This is to ensure all our Moderators are **actively** helping the site and community, and to make room for those who wish to have the role of Moderator.

## Current moderator panel UI details:
![modpowers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29495634/30305534-619d6b74-9741-11e7-88ba-db46bddaa080.png)

A page in the main section that has a list of all logged in players.  Players that have an IP that match another logged in player are in yellow with the IP next to them, if you see those, please take a look at what they are doing and respond appropriately, if they are in different games it is probably fine. Those using TOR have a red name and should be investigated and probably banned (As using TOR is against our Terms of Use) There is a checkbox next to each player. 

Below that list is an input field for Moderators to type in a player name.

At the bottom of the page are the following primary buttons (Moderators have access to all buttons above the line:

**Comment without action** - Use this to add info to the mod log.

**Clear/delete general chat** - Use this to clear all of general chat.

**Ban** - This permanently scrambles a user's password, rendering their account unusable.

**IP Timeout** - This IP bans a player for 18 hours without applying a normal ban which scrambles the password allowing for a softer punishment.

**Timeout** - This times out the user selected for 18 hours. Like the IP timeout but without restricting the users current IP address.

**Toggle player private-only** Turns a players account from  public to private or vice-versa and logs-out the selected user.

**Delete player cardback and log them out** - Use this for mildly inappropriate cardbacks.

**Delete game** - To use this, go into target game and copy the UID and paste in the player/game box. Use this to get rid of games that are cluttering the sidebar.

**Set general chat sticky** - creates a 'sticky' message that sticks to the top of general chat.  Can be used on broadcasts as well.  To remove a sticky, set sticky with a space in the comment box.

**Toggle: Disable account creation** - Turn on to disable account creation.

**Toggle: Disable ipbans including new account restrictions** - Turn on to disable ipbans including new account restrictions.

There is an input field so that Moderators can explain why they took this action that is logged, as well as who did it, and which action it was. Upon pressing submit with any of these buttons, the component refreshes and the checkboxes clear. 

In the upper left corner is a link to broadcast a message to all users (all games and generalchat).  Use this if there is a troll attack i.e. "please be careful when joining games with 0/0 players as we are having some trolls that we are attempting to deal with" or something like that.  Admins will be using this for patch/downtime alerts as well.

Mods will have a blue user name with an off white "(M)" after their name in userlist (and put on top regardless of win %) and game (observer only) and gen chat.

## Current reports panel UI details:
![modreport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29495634/30305519-545143be-9741-11e7-9e89-3d994d124e08.png)

There is a yellow chat bubble button in the upper right corner.  If a player has made a report in a game, and no Moderators have clicked on the chat bubble, it will be glowing for all mods, even if they were not logged in.  After a Moderator has clicked on it, sending them to the reports page, it will no longer glow until a new report is made.

Clicking on the yellow chat bubble brings them to the reports panel detailing all reports made.

While in the report panel there is a toggle option to "check" that the report has been handled appropriately titled **Resolved**.  Feel free to make use of this feature (or use the discord report channel and appropriate emoji reactions) 

## Current Ban Procedure

**Here is the agreed upon banning procedure**

When you become aware of an issue of a user first go to the Moderation Log and search (using F3 key) their name to see if they have done something before.

See for yourself (whether in game or through screen shots) if the claims appear to be true.

Make sure you have the users attention and inform them that their behavior is bannable and that they need to shape up.

Make note of this both on the [Discord's private moderation chat](https://discord.gg/secrethitlerio) and in the Moderation Log on the site.

If this is a second offense give a stern warning and make second note.

If third time use the normal ban *ONLY*.

IP bans should be used *sparingly*, in cases of users making multiple new accounts and spamming with them, or any situation which makes sense for the user to not be allowed back on for 18 hours.

In certain situations one can understand that if the offense happens a second time then, a ban is in place. So take it case by case, as long as they receive the first warning.

However there are special situations that should be banned right away (as long as they are not in game, as to not ruin an on-going game; unless everyone in said game is okay with the ban) these situations can be found on this GitHub mod page under the ["Absolute No Tolerance For"](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/wiki/Moderation#absolutely-no-tolerance-for) section.  

## 🔰Editor

Editors are a tier above Moderators and therefore have more powers and overall influence.
Below are listed the extra powers Editors have:

**Set wins/losses** - Instead of a comment, put a number to set a players stats.  Please do not misuse this for fun.  *Too much.*

**Set R (rainbow) wins/losses** - Same with setting a user's wins/losses except this will set their rainbow games' wins/losses.

**Ban & IP ban player for: 18 hours/one week** - Does the ban action and then adds that player's IP to a list that is checked against whenever a player attempts to log in or make a new account.  This should only be used in extreme circumstances like serial griefing/trolling.

**Delete user** - Deletes the specific user, username, and password from database.  Should be used to restore/remake accounts.

**Delete/reset player profile** - As player profiles are stored separate from username and password, this deletes the specific user's profile.  Should be used to completely reset a player and/or clear all of a player's mark on the game.

**Reset server (double click)** - Resets the server. Use sparingly!
