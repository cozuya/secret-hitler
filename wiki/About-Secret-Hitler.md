# [About Secret Hitler IO](https://www.secrethitler.io/about)

You can contact the developer at chris.v.ozols@gmail.com. Want to [contribute](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this open source product?  Check out the github page and issues - any accepted [pull request](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/pulls) will get you a cool orange name!

Application designed and developed from the original board game by [Chris Ozols](http://www.twolongos.com/). Due to a fairly complicated UI and text-driven gameplay this application is not mobile-optimized, but should work OK on mobile devices in theory. Source code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler). Bugs/issues? Contact me via [email](mailto:chris.v.ozols@gmail.com), [discord channel](https://discord.gg/secrethitlerio), or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cozuya/secret-hitler/issues).

### Privacy Policy

Your encrypted password is securely stored and is not accessible by anyone. Your user name or any chats you've made is not publicly accessible and not indexed by search engines. Moderators have access to see your IP address on a private moderation panel - this is used solely to guard against cheating and is never publically available.

### Terms of Use *(general)*

Don't cheat. Don't be a jerk/excessive abusive chat. Don't collude. Don't try to turn away newbies from your games. Don't attempt to circumvent things like not being able to select text from the gamechat or screenshotting/uploading your role. No TOR users. No homophobic/racist/sexist/nazi/anti-semitic stuff i.e. no hate speech. Public game chat must be in a language that all players know. Play to win for the team you're dealt. Be a good loser and a gracious winner. Have fun!

### Terms of Use *(usernames)*

Usernames must not consist of ethnic slurs, religious intolerance, or content that is pornographic, obscene, or abusive. Usernames that do not adhere to these rules may be toggled to private-games-only or banned by moderators, however, memey usernames such as "HutlerDidNothingWrong" or "dickbutt" are probably OK. If you wish to sign up with a username that is not allowed, please do us all a favor and toggle on "Private game player only" when setting up an account.

### Terms of Use *(player uploaded cardbacks)*

Everything in the general terms of use, plus: no pornography or anything not safe for work, no nazi imagery whatsoever including images of historical figures (very slight exemptions for parody may be OK on a case-by-case basis - no swastikas), no images/screenshots of the game itself to attempt to trick people (no matter how amusing it is..).

### Terms of Use *(private games)*

While some leeway may be given at moderator discretion, private games are still subject to the above site rules. Private games are not really private in that anyone can observe them, but only seated players and moderators can see chat. If you are here only to play private games and desperately need to call people NSFW things in chat or name yourself inappropriately, please make sure you check the "private game only" option when signing up, or convert yourself to that option in the game settings screen.

### Alterations to the original game:

- Minor image alterations and editing.

- Veto power is slightly adjusted so that chancellors need to select a policy prior to saying yes or no to vetoing that policy.

- Adapted the [rules webpage](https://www.secrethitler.io/rules) slightly to account for online vs physical play.

- There is an option when players make a game to "rebalance" the 6, 7 and 9 player games - 6p starts with a fascist policy already enacted, the other 2 starts with one less fascist policy in the deck. Players (and results from analyzing statistics) have noted that these game modes are the worst balanced and not fun to play with the original ruleset.
